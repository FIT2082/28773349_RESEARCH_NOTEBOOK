# Week 10
### Working on the system
Over the mid semester break and this week, we tried once again to model the hand data on the model. We gave up as it doesn't seem to be possible in the short time frame we have; we need to start user testing soon, as the project is coming to a close soon. 

Andrew has modelled the hand data as a combination of spheres and cylinders to represent joints and bones, much like the ghost hands in front of the user. We planned to use Han's humanoid model but without the hands, just connecting the wrist to Andrew's hands. To remove the hands from the model we explored a few options:

* Change the mesh and texture of the model's hands to 0% opacity
* Find our own model

None of these seemed possible, as the mesh and texture is one unit, so we cannot just change it at one spot. The only Unity humanoid assets we could find looked like characters from games, like zombies or characters in Halo. We have decided to scale the hand component of the model to 0, and fix the position of the wrist stump to the base of the hands. 

When I tried to do this however, someone had updated the version of Unity on the shared computer, which we had been avoiding, since the migration may affect our project. And it did. We now have missing components, so we will need to fix that next week. Hopefully it will be a quick fix. 

Our system is almost done, except for fixing the missing components and creating a 2D version, which will not be hard. We may also have to implement an algorithm to randomly select signs for the user. 

### Poster
We discussed our poster with Dr Kirsten this week. She gave us tips on how to design a poster that effectuvely communicates information. I went to mt local officeworks on the way home and enquired about the time it would take to print the poster and how much it would cost. It should take approximately 3 days and $35 for our A0 poster.

### Ethics resubmission
We needed to review our ethics submission, so hopefully we will be cleared to do user testing next week.
