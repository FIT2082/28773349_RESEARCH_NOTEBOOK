# Week 4
## Design science
This week Andrew and I worked solely on the project spec. Due to the nature of our research and what we aim to produce, we had to reconsider how to structure our methodology.

Our research has a broad scope and encompasses both technical aspects and social constructs. As a result, we needed convey both the motivation and method in our project spec, in particular, the methodology section. 

Peffers et al published *The Design Science Research Process: A Model for Producing and Presenting Information Systems Research*. We will follow this model in our research process. 

#### 1. Problem identification and motivation
In this section we need to identify and justify the need for our research and highlight its relevance to society. For Andrew and I, our motivation is to give hearing people the tools to learn sign language utilising virtual reality. 

#### 2. Objecives of a solution
This section emphasises the effects of our research. Our project aims to mitigate the communication barrier bewteen hearing and deaf people.

#### 3. Design and development 
In this section, we outline how we will implement the system. This part explains the technical side of the project, touching on the technology we will use, like software, hardware and testing systems. 

This structure was utilised in our project spec. It is a different way of presenting our research plan, as it included not only the technical steps which we aim to implement, but also encompassed the social motivation behind our research. 

## Next week
Dr Kirsten has an Occulus Rift and a computer with a sufficiently powerful graphics card for us to use. We plan to set it up in her office and work on our project there. We have obtained Han's DTW code so that we can use it in our system. I think next week will be more technical as we begin implementing our system.
