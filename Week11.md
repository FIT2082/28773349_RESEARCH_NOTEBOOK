# Week 11
### Finishing the app
This week we finished the app. After we lost last week's components and game objects, I was worried it would not be ready in time. However, we were able to drag and drop the prefabs back in. Phew. Andrew and I decided to remove the arms from the model completely, and draw in our own arms using spheres and cylinders. 

Andrew also added in a score bar, and with Dr Kirsten's suggestion, we may collect data concerning the accuracy with which user's make the signs. This will be intersting to add to our report. 

### Ethics
After mulitple rejections, our ethics application was finally approved. This means that next week we can commence our user study.

### Poster and report
We will begin to work on the report and continue working on the poster this week, while we conduct the user testing. We may not be able to put the results of the study on the poster, but they will be definitely be included in the report. 

This week we will send our poster for printing on Tuesday, so it will be ready on Thursday, in time for Friay's presentation.
