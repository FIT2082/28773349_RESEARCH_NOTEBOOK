# Week 6
## Perception Neuron
The aim of our project is to teach sign language using virtual reality. To do this, we need to have models of signs for the user to see and copy, and for us to verify if their performed sign is similiar to the actual sign. Our plan is to record a native Auslan signer performing these signs. The Perception Neuron (PN) https://neuronmocap.com seemed to be our best option. It is portable, comfortable to wear and most importantly, has integration with Unity. 

A PN is comprised of a set of neurons. Each neuron has a **3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope sensor and 3-axis magnetometer**. Each neuron is attatched to straps or gloves at all joints of the user, and enables us to track movements of a person. 

Dr Kirsten has arranged for us to have access to a PN kit on campus. We will be using the kits alongside FIT2087, so we have to coordinate times to use them, when the labs are not running. On Wednesday we began our investigation of using the PN and testing to see if it was a viable option. 

Andrew and I downloaded the Axis Neuron software on my laptop, but we were not able to detect the PN, even though it was plugged in and the lights were flashing. Under the impression that we may have picked up a faulty kit, we tried with another kit but we were not successful. 

We tried again on Friday, but used the desktop computer set up in Dr Kirsten's office, and tried to Windows version of the software. This time we were successful, and we were able to begin using the PN. After calibrating the PN, we found that the level of accuracy was not adequate. The PN is unable to detect that our finger tips are touching nor can it precisely determine the exact position of each finger. While it is accurate for whole body tracking, the fine motor movements are not perfectly detected, which proves to be a problem for us. 

We Googled our problems and tried to find a solution, as we thought that we had not correctly calibrated the kit. These are the solutions we tried:
* Recalibrating the PN, paying particular attention to arm and finger positioning. This helped a little bit, when putting our palms together, but still did not improve the finger tip tracking ability
* Adjusting the user dimensions. We were able to adjust the height, arm span and forearm length of the user, which did not significantly improve the performance of the PN, and the finger positioning was still off
* Readjusting the straps to sit on each joint in a particualr orientation. Initially, we had put on the straps backwards. We had high hopes that this would fix our problems, but sadly, it didn't. We also meticulously positioned each sensor on each joint in the hopes of improving our results. Again, it did not help.

I think we may not use the PN to record the signs. It is not accurate enough and may present more problems and work later on. We have arranged for our signer to work with us next Thursday, so we will need to find a solution fast. We may use the Leap Motion, but it is unable to detect hands when one obfuscates the other.
