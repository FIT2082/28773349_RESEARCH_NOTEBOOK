# Week 9
### Mapping points on the model
Thi week was mostly hacking code together. I tried to map the hand data to the model, but it is proving to be more difficult than I thought. Han suggested that we use code from the prefabs in order to avoid rewriting an entire library, but it did not work out. Each class from the prefab collection inherits multiple times, and we ended up copying and pasting random methods from each class. Unfortunately, this didn't work, and the finger tips touched the sky, and it was just a mess. Abandoned that idea.

We did not have a meeting with Dr Kirsten this week, but we have been corresponding via email. We may see her during mid sem. 

### Next week
Next week is mid sem break. I hope to get the mapping done before the end of break so that we will be ready for our user testing, as ethics should be approved by then too.
